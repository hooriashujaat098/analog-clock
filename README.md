⏰ Realistic Analog Clock

A simple and realistic analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helped me understand how real-time updates work in JavaScript and how to manipulate the DOM to create smooth visual changes.


🔹 About the Project

This analog clock shows the current system time and updates every second.
The hour, minute, and second hands rotate dynamically using JavaScript and CSS transforms.

The main goal of this project was to practice:

DOM selection

Working with Date and time

JavaScript logic with real visual output


🔹 Technologies Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

No libraries. No frameworks. Pure JavaScript.


🔹 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

How to use the Date object to get real time

How setInterval works for continuous updates

How to rotate elements using CSS transform

How JavaScript connects logic with UI through the DOM

This project made JavaScript feel more practical and visual.
